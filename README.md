# vba_challenge
## Overview of the Project
Steve's analysis of stocks for the years 2017 and 2018 worked well for the quantity that he currently had on file. However, Steve identified that the code needed to be refined in order for it to be used for mass amounts of data. The request was to take the code that had been created initially through Module 2 and refactor it so that it was more prepared to handle mass amounts of data. If the refactoring was successful, we would see a significant increase in the speed in which the code was able to operate.
## Results of Analysis and VBA Refactoring
The refactoring of the VBA was successful as it was able to cut down on the time it took for the code to look through all data points significantly. The images below are indicative of the times before refactoring and after refactoring.
